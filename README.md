## Description of the Two Scripts

Both scripts are command-line tools written in Python that provide three main functions for managing audio files:

1. **Check Audio File Integrity**: Uses FFmpeg to verify if audio files are corrupt or playable.
2. **Hide or Show Cover Art Files**: Renames cover art files (e.g., `cover.jpg`) by adding or removing a dot prefix to hide or show them.
3. **Analyze Audio File Metadata**: Uses ffprobe to extract and display metadata such as bitrate, sample rate, and codec.

The primary difference between the two versions lies in their approach to progress indication:

- **Version 1** uses the `tqdm` library for advanced, feature-rich progress bars.
- **Version 2** implements a custom ASCII progress bar without external dependencies.

Beyond this, there are minor differences in output handling and code structure, which we'll explore below.

## Common Features and Setup

Before diving into the differences, here’s what both scripts share and how to set them up:

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **FFmpeg and ffprobe**: Both scripts rely on these external tools for audio processing and analysis.
  - **Windows**: Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add to your PATH.
  - **macOS**: Install via Homebrew with `brew install ffmpeg`.
  - **Linux**: Use your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg` on Ubuntu.
  - Verify installation by running `ffmpeg -version` and `ffprobe -version` in your terminal.
- **Configuration File**: Both scripts use a JSON file named `audio-script-config.json` to store settings, such as the log folder path. If it doesn’t exist, the script creates it with a default log folder of `"Logs"`.

### Supported Audio Formats
Both scripts recognize the following audio file extensions:
- `.flac`, `.wav`, `.m4a`, `.mp3`, `.ogg`, `.opus`, `.ape`, `.wv`, `.wma`

### Command-Line Usage
Run the scripts from the command line with one of three commands: `check`, `cover-art`, or `info`. Examples:
- **Integrity Check**: `python script.py check /path/to/audio/files`
- **Hide Cover Art**: `python script.py cover-art --hide /path/to/directory`
- **Analyze Metadata**: `python script.py info /path/to/audio/files`

Now, let’s examine each version in detail.

## Version 1: Using `tqdm` for Progress Bars

This version leverages the `tqdm` library to provide a sophisticated progress bar experience.

### Key Features
- **Progress Bars**: Uses `tqdm` to display progress for operations like integrity checks, cover art processing, and metadata analysis. The bar includes percentage complete, file count, and estimated time remaining.
- **Verbose and Summary Options**:
  - `--verbose`: Prints detailed results to the console without a progress bar.
  - `--summary`: Shows a progress bar during processing and a summary at the end (total files, passed, failed).
- **Log File Handling**: Saves results to a log file in the specified log folder if `--save-log` is used or if neither `--verbose` nor `--summary` is specified for the `check` command.
- **Output for `info` Command**: Metadata analysis results can be printed to the console with `--verbose` or saved to a file (default: `audio_analysis_YYYYMMDD.txt`).

### Setup Instructions
1. **Install Python and FFmpeg**: See the common setup above.
2. **Install `tqdm`**:
   - Run the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     pip install tqdm
     ```
   - This adds the `tqdm` library, which is not part of the Python standard library.
3. **Save the Script**: Copy the code from the first document into a file, e.g., `audio_tool_tqdm.py`.
4. **Run the Script**: Use the command-line examples provided earlier.

### How to Use
- **Check Integrity with Progress Bar**:
  ```bash
  python audio_tool_tqdm.py check /path/to/audio/files --summary
  ```
  - Displays a `tqdm` progress bar and a summary of passed/failed files.
- **Hide Cover Art**:
  ```bash
  python audio_tool_tqdm.py cover-art --hide /path/to/directory
  ```
  - Shows a progress bar while renaming cover art files.
- **Analyze Metadata and Save to File**:
  ```bash
  python audio_tool_tqdm.py info /path/to/audio/files
  ```
  - Outputs results to a timestamped file (e.g., `audio_analysis_20231015.txt`).

### Output Example
For `check` with `--summary`:
```
Checking files: 100%|██████████| 50/50 [00:05<00:00, 10.00it/s]
Summary:
Total files: 50
Passed: 48
Failed: 2
```

### Pros
- **Rich Progress Bar**: Includes estimated time remaining and a smooth update experience.
- **Simpler Code**: Relies on `tqdm` to handle progress tracking, reducing custom implementation effort.
- **User-Friendly**: Ideal for users processing large directories who want detailed feedback.

### Cons
- **Dependency**: Requires installing `tqdm`, which may not be feasible in restricted environments.
- **Slight Overhead**: `tqdm` introduces a minimal performance cost.

## Version 2: Using Custom ASCII Progress Bar

This version implements a simple ASCII progress bar manually, avoiding external dependencies.

### Key Features
- **Progress Bars**: Uses a custom `print_progress_bar` function to display a basic ASCII bar showing percentage and file count (e.g., `[#####-----] 50% 25/50`).
- **Verbose and Summary Options**: Identical to Version 1: `--verbose` for detailed output, `--summary` for progress bar and summary.
- **Log File Handling**: Same as Version 1—logs are saved if `--save-log` is specified or if no output mode is chosen.
- **Output for `info` Command**: Matches Version 1, with results to console via `--verbose` or to a file (default: `audio_analysis_YYYYMMDD.txt`).

### Setup Instructions
1. **Install Python and FFmpeg**: See the common setup above.
2. **No Additional Libraries**: Unlike Version 1, no extra installations are needed beyond Python and FFmpeg.
3. **Save the Script**: Copy the code from the second document into a file, e.g., `audio_tool_ascii.py`.
4. **Run the Script**: Use the same command-line syntax as Version 1.

### How to Use
- **Check Integrity with Progress Bar**:
  ```bash
  python audio_tool_ascii.py check /path/to/audio/files --summary
  ```
  - Shows a custom ASCII bar and a summary.
- **Show Cover Art**:
  ```bash
  python audio_tool_ascii.py cover-art --show /path/to/directory
  ```
  - Displays progress while renaming files.
- **Analyze Metadata with Verbose Output**:
  ```bash
  python audio_tool_ascii.py info /path/to/audio/files --verbose
  ```
  - Prints metadata directly to the console.

### Output Example
For `check` with `--summary`:
```
Checking files [####################--------------------] 50% 25/50
Checking files [########################################] 100% 50/50
Summary:
Total files: 50
Passed: 48
Failed: 2
```

### Pros
- **No Dependencies**: Runs with just Python and FFmpeg, making it highly portable.
- **Lightweight**: Avoids any overhead from external libraries.
- **Simple**: Sufficient for basic progress tracking needs.

### Cons
- **Basic Progress Bar**: Lacks advanced features like estimated time remaining.
- **More Code**: Requires maintaining a custom progress bar implementation.

## How to Choose Between Them

- **Choose Version 1 (tqdm)** if:
  - You want a detailed progress bar with estimated time remaining.
  - You’re comfortable installing `tqdm` via pip.
  - You’re processing large directories and need better feedback.

- **Choose Version 2 (Custom ASCII)** if:
  - You prefer a script with no external dependencies.
  - A basic progress bar meets your needs.
  - You’re in an environment where installing libraries is restricted.

Both scripts are robust and well-designed, so your choice depends on your priorities regarding dependencies, progress bar features, and setup simplicity.

## Additional Notes

- **Error Handling**: Both versions check for FFmpeg/ffprobe availability and validate input paths, exiting gracefully with error messages if requirements aren’t met.
- **Customizing the Log Folder**: Edit `audio-script-config.json` to change the `"log_folder"` value. Ensure the script has write permissions for that location.
- **Extending Functionality**: To support more audio formats, add extensions to the `AUDIO_EXTENSIONS` list. For additional metadata, modify the `analyze_audio` function.
